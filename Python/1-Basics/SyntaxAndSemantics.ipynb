    "Python Basics: Syntax and Semantics\n",

    "Syntax and Semantics in Python\n",
    "Syntax refers to the set of rules that defines the combination of symbols considered to be a correctly structured program in a language. In simpler terms, syntax is about the correct arrangement of words and symbols in code. When coding, syntax errors often occur if, for example, a variable is used without being assigned. This is why correct arrangement is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantics refers to the meaning or interpretation of the symbols, characters, and commands in a language. It is about what the code is supposed to do when it runs. Syntax is about how we arrange the words to write code, while semantics refers to the interpretationâ€”what the code is supposed to do when it runs."
